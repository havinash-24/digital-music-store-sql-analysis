## Project Description: 
This project involves querying a digital music store database (Chinook Database) to extract useful insights. The goal is to assist the Chinook team in understanding their customers, employees, media in the store, and invoice information.

In this project, various SQL queries, including advanced queries, are written to address business questions that help with decision-making in the Chinook store. The database includes tables such as Customer, Invoice, Artist, Track, and more.

## Database ERD
The Chinook Database schema includes several tables such as Customer, Invoice, Artist, Track, and more. Refer to the official Chinook ERD for detailed information.
You can download the Chinook Database from the official repository:
